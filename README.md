## Set up

 Install a smart IDE, like PyCharm. Clone the repository to your local machine. You need to navigate to the code in GitHub that you want to 
 clone. In GitHub press the green Code button, you can see that there are a few ways to do this. We're going to use HTTPS as it can be the 
 simplest option. From the HTTPS tab, click the clipboard icon, this copies the URL to your clipboard. Now you've got the link from GitHub, 
 you need to open PyCharm. If you don't have any projects option, you'll see the Welcome Screen. You will see an option here to Get from 
 Version Control (or similar depending on the version of IntelliJ IDEA). If you do have a project open already, you can do the same action 
 from the File > New > Project from Version Control menu. In older versions of IntelliJ IDEA, you can also use go to VCS > Get from Version 
 Control. This menu option was renamed to Git > Clone in newer versions (when you have an existing Git project open). When you press this 
 button, you will get an option to select your Version Control location, GitHub in this instance, and then to enter the URL that's on your 
 clipboard into the URL field. Press Enter or Clone to clone the GitHub repository to the directory you selected.
